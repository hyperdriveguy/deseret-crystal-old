Let me tell you a story from long ago...

[fade to black]

In the 1800s, there once was a prosperous and beautiful city on
the American frontier. The name of the city was Nauvoo.

The city was inhabited by what many viewed as a strange people.
They believed that God had sent another prophet: Joseph Smith.

Through Joseph Smith they obtained The Book of Mormon, scriptural text about
the about ancient civilizations in America.
Both Joseph and The Book of Mormon came under great scrutiny.
Many had taken to calling those who believed in The Book of Mormon as
scripture “Mormons.”

They suffered much persecution for the beliefs.
After being driven from place to place and some being martyred by those they
once called their friends, all the believers founded Nauvoo hoping it would be
their final place of refuge from persecution.

But alas.

After a few years of relative peace in Nauvoo, the persecutors laid waiting
for a time to strike a final blow to this religion.
They hoped to kill Joseph Smith.

After being put in jail awaiting trial, a mob stormed into the jail, killing
Joseph Smith and his beloved brother.
Shortly after his death, the citizens of Nauvoo were threatened yet again and
forced to move.

And so they headed west, being led by a new head: Brigham Young.
After coming upon the unimpressive and not-so-fertile land,
Brigham made the declaration:
This is the place.

And so, under the direction of Brigham Young, the settlers and their Pokémon
started to irrigate the land.

???: Wait, what?
???: They had Pokémon?

Narrator: I thought I was certain that’s how the story went, but…
